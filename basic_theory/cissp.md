CISSP
# CISSP

## Security and Risk Management
focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law.

- Security goals and objectives
- Risk mitigation processes
- Compliance
- Business continuity plans
- Legal regulations
- Professional and organizational ethics

An organization may use playbooks and implement training as a part of their security and risk management program, based on their needs and perceived risk. There are many InfoSec design processes, such as:

- Incident response
- Vulnerability management
- Application security
- Cloud security
- Infrastructure security

## Asset Security

## Security Architecture and Engineering
concept of shared responsibility. Shared responsibility means all individuals involved take an active role in lowering risk during the design of a security system.

- Threat modeling
- Least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Fail securely
- Separation of duties
- Keep it simple
- Zero trust
- Trust but verify

## Communication and Network Security
Managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. 
As a security analyst, you may be asked to analyze user behavior within your organization.
Organizations with remote, hybrid, and on-site work environments must ensure data remains secure, but managing external connections to make certain that remote workers are securely accessing an organization’s networks is a challenge. Designing network security controls—such as restricted network access—can help protect users and ensure an organization’s network remains secure when employees travel or work outside of the main office.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.
IAM uses what is referred to as the principle of least privilege, which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task
as a security analyst, you may be tasked with setting up employees' keycard access to buildings.

## Security Assessment and Testing
mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities

## Security Operation
focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. Imagine that you, as a security analyst, receive an alert that an unknown device has been connected to your internal network. You would need to follow the organization's policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat.

- Training and awareness
- Reporting and documentation
- Intrusion detection and prevention
- SIEM tools
- Log management
- Incident management
- Playbooks
- Post-breach forensics
- Reflecting on lessons learned

## Software Development Security
focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services. 
A security analyst may work with software development teams to ensure security practices are incorporated into the software development life-cycle. 
If, for example, one of your partner teams is creating a new mobile app, then you may be asked to advise on the password policies or ensure that any user data is properly secured and managed.
