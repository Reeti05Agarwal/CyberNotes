# NIST

U.S.-based agency that develops multiple voluntary compliance frameworks that organizations worldwide can use to help manage risk.

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

**computer security incident response team (CSIRT)** and a **security operations center (SOC)**

framework for incident response consisting of four phases:

- Preparation
- Detection and Analysis
- Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- Post-incident activity

 **security operations center (SOC)** is an organizational unit dedicated to monitoring networks, systems, and devices for security threats or attacks. 

**Common Elements of Incident Response Plans**

- Incident response procedures
- System information (e.g., network diagrams, data flow diagrams, logging, asset inventory information)
- Other documents (e.g., contact lists, forms, templates)

### Functions:

1. **identify**:
2. **protect**
3. **detect**
4. **respond**
5. **recover**

Commonly known as the CSF, this framework was developed to help businesses secure one of their most important assets, information.

### CSF

### **Core**

The CSF core is a set of desired cybersecurity outcomes that help organizations customize their security plan. It consists of five functions, or parts: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.  

### **Tiers**

The CSF tiers are a way of measuring the sophistication of an organization's cybersecurity program. CSF tiers are measured on a scale of 1 to 4. Tier 1 is the lowest score, indicating that a limited set of security controls have been implemented.  

### **Profiles**

The CSF profiles are pre-made templates of the NIST CSF that are developed by a team of industry experts. They are used to help organizations develop a **baseline** for their cybersecurity plans, or as a way of comparing their current cybersecurity posture to a specific industry standard.

In any scenario, the U.S. **Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)** provides detailed guidance that any organization can use to implement the CSF. This is a quick overview and summary of their recommendations:

- **Create a current profile** of the security operations and outline the specific needs of your business.
- **Perform a risk assessment** to identify which of your current operations are meeting business and regulatory standards.
- **Analyze and prioritize existing gaps** in security operations that place the businesses assets at risk.
- **Implement a plan of action** to achieve your organizationâ€™s goals and objectives.
