# Packet Sniffers

A (**network protocol analyzer)** is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic in a network. It keeps a record of all the data that a computer within an organization's network encounters. Since all the traffic on a network is visible to any host on the hub, malicious actors can view all the information going in and out of the device they are targeting.

*   Passive

    passive packet sniffing attack to a postal delivery person maliciously reading somebody's mail. The postal worker, or packet sniffer, has the right to deliver the mail, but not the right to read the information inside.

*   Active

    Active packet sniffing is a type of attack where data packets are manipulated in transit. This may include injecting internet protocols to redirect the packets to an unintended port or changing the information the packet contains. Active packet sniffing attack would be like a neighbor telling the delivery person "I'll deliver that mail for you," and then reading the mail or changing the letter before putting it in your mailbox.
