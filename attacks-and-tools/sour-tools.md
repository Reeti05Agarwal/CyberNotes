# SOUR Tools

Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response

* Its a software designed to automate repetitive tasks stemming from tools like SIEM or MDR.
* It automates responses to security events, such as blocking a user's account after multiple failed login attempts, to prevent potential intrusions.
* Analysts can reference playbooks to follow predefined steps for resolving security issues.
* SOAR enables the collection of applications, tools, and workflows to automate responses to security incidents.
* The aim is to streamline the handling of common security incidents using SIEM tools, reducing the need for manual intervention.
* This automation allows security analysts to focus on handling more complex and rare incidents that cannot be automated through SOAR.
