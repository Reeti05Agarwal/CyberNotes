## Security Plans

## Security plans

based on the analysis of three elements:

* assets
* threats
* vulnerabilities

Asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affects them.

asset classification is the practice of labeling assets based on the sensitivity and importance to an organization.

* **Restricted** is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets, like need-to-know information.
* **Confidential** refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization.
* **Internal-only** describes assets that are available to employees and business partners.
* **Public** is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if they’re released.

### Challenges of classifying information

Identifying the owner of certain assets is straightforward, like the owner of a building. Other types of assets can be trickier to identify. This is especially true when it comes to information.

For example, a business might issue a laptop to one of its employees to allow them to work remotely. You might assume the business is the asset owner in this situation. But, what if the employee uses the laptop for personal matters, like storing their photos?

Ownership is just one characteristic that makes classifying information a challenge. Another concern is that information can have multiple classification values at the same time. For example, consider a letter addressed to you in the mail. The letter contains some public information that’s okay to share, like your name. It also contains fairly confidential pieces of information that you’d rather only be available to certain people, like your address. You’ll learn more about how these challenges are addressed as you continue through the program.

protecting data depends on where that data is and what it's doing.

#### Security teams protect data in three different states:

*   in use:

    Data in use is data being accessed by one or more users. Imagine being at a park with your laptop. It's a nice sunny day, and you stop at a bench to check your email. This is an example of data in use. As soon as you log in, your inbox is considered to be in use.
*   in transit:

    Data in transit is data traveling from one point to another. While you're signed into your account, a message from one of your friends appears. They sent you an interesting article about the growing security industry. You decide to reply, thanking them for sending this to you. When you click send, this is now an example of data in transit.
*   at rest :

    Data at rest is data not currently being accessed. In this state, data is typically stored on a physical device. An example of data at rest would be when you finish checking your email and close your laptop. You then decide to pack up and go to a nearby cafe for breakfast. As you make your way from the park towards the cafe, the data in your laptop is at rest.

#### Security plans consist of three basic elements:

*   Policy

    Its is a set of rules that reduce risk and protects information.They give everyone in and out of an organization guidance by addressing questions like, what are we protecting and why? Policies focus on the strategic side of things by identifying the scope, objectives, and limitations of a security plan. For instance, newly hired employees at many companies are required to sign off on acceptable use policy, or AUP. These provisions outline secure ways that an employee may access corporate systems.
*   Standards

    These have a tactical function, as they concern how well we're protecting assets. In security, standards are references that inform how to set policies. A good way to think of standards is that they create a point of reference. For example, many companies use the password management standard identified in NIST Special Publication 800-63B to improve their security policies by specifying that employees' passwords must be at least eight characters long.
*   Procedures

    step-by-step instructions to perform a specific security task. Organizations usually keep multiple procedure documents that are used throughout the company, like how employees can choose secure passwords, or how they can securely reset a password if it's been locked. Sharing clear and actionable procedures with everyone creates accountability, consistency, and efficiency across an organization.
