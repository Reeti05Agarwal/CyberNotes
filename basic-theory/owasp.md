# OWASP

**Open Web Application Security Project**

## **Security Principles**

nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Its an open platform that security professionals use to share information, tools, and events that are focused on securing the web.

### Attributes

* **Minimize attack surface area**
* **Principle of least privilege**
* **Defense in depth**
* **Separation of duties**
* **Keep security simple**
* **Fix security issues correctly**
* **Establish secure defaults:** This principle means that the optimal security state of an application is also its default state for users; it should take extra work to make the application insecure.
* **Fail securely:** Fail securely means that when a control fails or stops, it should do so by defaulting to its most secure option. For example, when a firewall fails it should simply close all connections and block all new ones, rather than start accepting everything.
* **Donâ€™t trust services**
* **Avoid security by obscurity** The security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden. Consider the following example from OWASP (2016): The security of an application should not rely on keeping the source code secret. Its security should rely upon many other factors, including reasonable password policies, defense in depth, business transaction limits, solid network architecture, and fraud and audit controls.
