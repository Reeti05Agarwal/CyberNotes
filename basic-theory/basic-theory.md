**Likelihood x Impact = Risk**

to estimate the likelihood of the risk is to determine the potential frequency of the risk occurring:

* _Could the risk happen once a day?_
* _Could the risk happen once a month?_
* _Could the risk happen once in a year?_

When evaluating the severity of a risk, consider the potential consequences of that risk occurring:

* _How would the business be affected?_
* _What's the financial harm to the business and its customers?_
* _Can important operations or services be impacted?_
* _Are there regulations that can be violated?_
* _What is the reputational damage to the company's standing?_
* **Information privacy** refers to the protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data.
* **Information security** (InfoSec) refers to the practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users.
