## Audits

## **Security audits**

Audits are independent reviews that evaluate whether an organization is meeting internal and external criteria. Internal criteria include outlined policies, procedures, and best practices. External criteria include regulatory compliance, laws, and federal regulations.

### The role of frameworks and controls in audits

Frameworks such as the NIST CSF and the ISO 27000 series are designed to help organizations prepare for regulatory compliance security audits. By adhering to these and other relevant frameworks, organizations can save time when conducting external and internal audits.

### Audit checklist

* **Identify the scope of the audit**
  * List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.)
  * Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
  * Indicate how often an audit should be performed
  * Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees
* **Complete a risk assessment**
  * A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).
* **Conduct the audit**
  * When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.
* **Create a mitigation plan**
  * A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organizationâ€™s security posture.
* **Communicate results to stakeholders**
  * The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of findings, suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk, and compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.
