## Types of IP

### Global IP Address

Its a singular IP address of your network.

Its a public IP Address.

### Local IP Address

Its private IP Address. Its the IP addresses assigned to the devices connected to the network.

Its given by modem through DHCP protocol.

## ISP (Internet Service provider)

ISP connects your device to the internet.

Its connects to your modem. which will give global IP address to the connected devices

* Similar to a person's address; known as the logical address.
* Assigned based on the host's location on the network by a network administrator.
* Contains two parts:
  * **Network Portion**: Same for all hosts on the same local network.
  * **Host Portion**: Unique to each host within the local network.

## The IPv4 Address:

* **Purpose of IPv4 Address**: Identifies a host on both local and global networks for communication.
*   **Format**:

    An IPv4 address consists of 32 binary bits.

    Binary Form converted to Dotted-decimal notation for readability.

    grouping the 32 bits into four 8-bit octets and presenting each as a decimal number separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.5).
*   **Total Addresses**:

    Over 4 billion possible addresses in a 32-bit scheme.

***

* **Unique**
* **Assignment**: Assigned to the network interface connection, typically a network interface card (NIC) in devices such as workstations, servers, network printers, and IP phones.
* **Multiple NICs**: Devices with multiple NICs, like some servers, will have an IPv4 address for each NIC.
* **Router Interfaces**: Routers connecting to IP networks also have IPv4 addresses.
* **Packet Information & Transfer**: Each packet sent over the internet includes source and destination IPv4 addresses to ensure proper delivery and reply routing.

#### Networks and Hosts in IPv4 Addressing

#### Components of an IPv4 Address:

1. **Network Portion**:
   * Identified by the subnet mask.
   * For 192.168.5.11/255.255.255.0, the network portion is 192.168.5.
   * Indicates the specific network.
2. **Host Portion**:
   * The remainder of the address.
   * For 192.168.5.11, the host portion is 11.
   * Identifies the specific host within the network.

#### Hierarchical Addressing:

* **Network Hierarchy**:
  * Routers use the network portion to determine the network location.
  * Simplifies routing by not needing to track each individual host.
* **Multiple Logical Networks**:
  * Different network portions can exist on the same physical network.
  * Example:
    * Hosts with 192.168.18.x are one logical network.
    * Hosts with 192.168.5.x are another logical network.
  * Communication between different logical networks requires routing.

#### Example Comparison:

* **Hierarchical Network Analogy**: Telephone system.
  * Country code, area code, exchange represent the network address.
  * Remaining digits represent the local phone number.

#### Visual Representation:

* **IPv4 Address Example**:
  * Address: 192.168.18.57
  * Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
  * Network portion: 192.168.18
  * Host portion: 57

#### Identifying the Network Address Using ANDing

To determine the network address of an IPv4 host, the IPv4 address is ANDed with the subnet mask bit by bit. This process reveals the network address.

#### Example: Host IPv4 Address 192.168.10.10 with Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0

1. **Convert to Binary**:
   * IPv4 Address: 192.168.10.10
     * Binary: 11000000 10101000 00001010 00001010
   * Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
     * Binary: 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
2. **ANDing Process**:
   * Perform a bitwise AND operation between the IPv4 address and the subnet mask.
   * The AND operation follows these rules:
     * 1 AND 1 = 1
     * 1 AND 0 = 0
     * 0 AND 1 = 0
     * 0 AND 0 = 0
3.  **Step-by-Step ANDing**:

    * Compare each bit of the IPv4 address with the corresponding bit in the subnet mask.

    ```
    11000000 10101000 00001010 00001010  (IPv4 Address)
    AND
    11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000  (Subnet Mask)
    -----------------------------------
    11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000  (Network Address)

    ```
4. **Result**:
   * **Network Address**: 192.168.10.0
     * Binary: 11000000 10101000 00001010 00000000

#### Calculating Whether the Destination is Local or Remote

To determine whether a destination IPv4 address is local or remote, a host uses its subnet mask to compare the network portions of its own IPv4 address and the destination IPv4 address. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Subnet Mask and IPv4 Address Configuration**:
   * Each host is configured with an IPv4 address and a subnet mask.
   * The subnet mask indicates which bits of the IPv4 address are the network portion and which are the host portion.
2. **Bit-by-Bit Comparison**:
   * The host compares its subnet mask to its own IPv4 address and the destination IPv4 address.
   * The 1s in the subnet mask represent the network portion, and the 0s represent the host portion.
3. **Determine the Network Address**:
   * Perform a bitwise AND operation between the IPv4 address and the subnet mask to determine the network address.
   * Repeat the AND operation for both the source and destination addresses.
4. **Compare Network Addresses**:
   * If the network portions of both addresses match, the destination is on the same local network.
   * If they do not match, the destination is on a remote network.

#### Example

#### Host IPv4 Address and Subnet Mask

* **Host IPv4 Address**: 192.168.1.10
* **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0
* **Binary Representation**:
  * IPv4 Address: 11000000 10101000 00000001 00001010
  * Subnet Mask: 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000

#### Destination IPv4 Address

* **Destination IPv4 Address**: 192.168.1.20
* **Binary Representation**:
  * IPv4 Address: 11000000 10101000 00000001 00010100

#### Determine Network Addresses

*   **Host Network Address**:

    ```
    11000000 10101000 00000001 00001010
    AND
    11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
    -----------------------------------
    11000000 10101000 00000001 00000000 (192.168.1.0)

    ```
*   **Destination Network Address**:

    ```
    11000000 10101000 00000001 00010100
    AND
    11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
    -----------------------------------
    11000000 10101000 00000001 00000000 (192.168.1.0)

    ```

Since both the host and destination network addresses are **192.168.1.0**, the destination is local.

#### Example with Remote Destination

#### Different Destination IPv4 Address

* **Destination IPv4 Address**: 192.168.2.20
* **Binary Representation**:
  * IPv4 Address: 11000000 10101000 00000010 00010100

#### Determine Network Addresses

* **Host Network Address**: (As calculated previously, 192.168.1.0)
*   **Destination Network Address**:

    ```
    11000000 10101000 00000010 00010100
    AND
    11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
    -----------------------------------
    11000000 10101000 00000010 00000000 (192.168.2.0)

    ```

Since the host network address is **192.168.1.0** and the destination network address is **192.168.2.0**, the destination is remote.

#### Calculating the Number of Hosts in a Subnet

#### Common Subnet Masks and Host Calculations

1. **Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0 (8-bits)**
   * **Network Bits**: 8
   * **Host Bits**: 32 - 8 = 24
   * **Total Hosts**: 2^24 = 16,777,216
   * **Usable Hosts**: 16,777,216 - 2 = 16,777,214
2. **Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0 (16-bits)**
   * **Network Bits**: 16
   * **Host Bits**: 32 - 16 = 16
   * **Total Hosts**: 2^16 = 65,536
   * **Usable Hosts**: 65,536 - 2 = 65,534
3. **Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 (24-bits)**
   * **Network Bits**: 24
   * **Host Bits**: 32 - 24 = 8
   * **Total Hosts**: 2^8 = 256
   * **Usable Hosts**: 256 - 2 = 254

#### Host Calculation Process

1. **Identify the number of host bits** in the subnet mask by subtracting the number of network bits from 32.
2. **Calculate the total number of possible host addresses** using 2^number of host bits.
3. **Subtract 2** from the total to account for the network address (all host bits 0) and the broadcast address (all host bits 1).

#### Classful Addressing (1981)

#### Address Classes

#### Address Allocation

* **Class A**: 50% of available IPv4 addresses
* **Class B**: 25% of available IPv4 addresses
* **Class C, D, and E**: Remaining 25% of available IPv4 addresses

#### Issues

* **Wastage**: Many addresses were unused, especially in Class A and B.
* **Depletion**: Rapid growth of the internet highlighted inefficiencies and exhaustion of address space.

#### Classless Addressing (CIDR)

#### Key Features

* **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: Adopted in the late 1990s.
* **Flexible Subnet Masks**: Subnet masks can be of any length, allowing more efficient allocation of addresses.
* **Address Allocation**: Based on the number of required hosts, not fixed classes.

#### Private IPv4 Addressing

#### Definition

* **Public IPv4 Addresses**: Globally routable and used on the internet.
* **Private IPv4 Addresses**: Used within internal networks and not routable on the internet.

#### Private Address Blocks (RFC 1918)

1. **10.0.0.0/8**
   * Range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
2. **172.16.0.0/12**
   * Range: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
3. **192.168.0.0/16**
   * Range: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

#### Characteristics

* **Not Unique**: Can be used by multiple organizations.
* **Non-Routable on the Internet**: Must be filtered by internet routers and discarded if seen in public traffic.

#### Usage

* **Internal Networks**: Used to assign addresses to hosts within an organization's internal network.
* **Home Networks**: Commonly used by home routers to assign addresses to connected devices.

#### Network Address Translation (NAT)

* **Purpose**: Translates private IPv4 addresses to public IPv4 addresses for communication over the internet.
* **Function**: Usually performed by the router connecting an internal network to the ISP's network.
* **Example in Homes**: Home routers often use private addresses like 192.168.1.0/24 for internal devices, while the router's interface connecting to the ISP uses a public IPv4 address.

#### Assignment of IPv4 Addresses

#### Public IPv4 Address Allocation

* **Unique Requirement**: Public addresses must be unique globally.
* **Regulation and Allocation**: Managed and allocated separately to each organization.

#### Managing Authorities

1. **Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)**
   * Website: [IANA](http://www.iana.org/)
   * Manages global IP address allocation.
2. **Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)**
   * Allocates IP addresses to ISPs and organizations within their respective regions.

#### Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)

* **AfriNIC (African Network Information Center)**
  * Region: Africa
* **APNIC (Asia Pacific Network Information Centre)**
  * Region: Asia/Pacific
* **ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers)**
  * Region: North America
* **LACNIC (Latin American and Caribbean IP Address Registry)**
  * Region: Latin America and Caribbean Islands
* **RIPE NCC (Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre)**
  * Region: Europe, Middle East, and Central Asia

#### IP Address Allocation Process

1. **IANA** allocates blocks of IP addresses to **RIRs**.
2. **RIRs** allocate IP address blocks to **ISPs** and organizations.
3. **ISPs** provide smaller IP address blocks to their customers (organizations and smaller ISPs).
4. **Organizations** can also obtain addresses directly from an **RIR**, subject to RIR policies.

#### Geographic Locations of RIRs

* **AfriNIC**: Africa
* **APNIC**: Asia/Pacific
* **ARIN**: North America
* **LACNIC**: Latin America and Caribbean Islands
* **RIPE NCC**: Europe, Middle East, Central Asia

#### Unicast Transmission

* **Unicast communication** is used for normal host-to-host communication in both client/server and peer-to-peer networks.
* Unicast is the default mode of communication unless specified otherwise.
* **Unicast packets** use the address of the destination device as the destination address and can be routed through an internetwork.

**Unicast Address Range:**

* IPv4 unicast host addresses range from **0.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255**.
* Certain addresses within this range are reserved for special purposes and cannot be used for regular unicast communication.

**Key Points:**

* **Host Address:** The unicast address assigned to an end device.
* **Source and Destination Addresses:** For unicast communication, the source host uses its own IPv4 address as the source address and the destination host's IPv4 address as the destination address.
* **Encapsulation Process:** During this process, the source address is always the unicast address of the originating host, irrespective of the packet type (unicast, broadcast, or multicast).

#### Broadcast Transmission

* **Broadcast communication** involves sending packets to all hosts within a network using a broadcast address.

**Broadcast Address:**

* The packet contains a destination IPv4 address with all ones (1s) in the host portion (e.g., 255.255.255.255 for a limited broadcast).

**Types of Broadcast:**

1. **Directed Broadcast:**
   * Sent to all hosts on a specific network.
   * Example: A packet sent to 172.16.4.255 on the 172.16.4.0/24 network.
2. **Limited Broadcast:**
   * Sent to all hosts on the local network.
   * Example: A packet sent to 255.255.255.255.

**Behavior and Usage:**

* **Receiving Packets:**
  * All hosts on the local network (broadcast domain) will receive and process the packet.
  * This is similar to processing a unicast address packet.
* **Protocols Using Broadcasts:**
  * Many network protocols, such as DHCP, rely on broadcast transmissions to function.

**Network Impact:**

* **Resource Usage:**
  * Broadcast packets consume network resources and require all receiving hosts to process the packets.
  * Excessive broadcast traffic can degrade network and device performance.
* **Router Behavior:**
  * By default, routers do not forward broadcast packets, thus containing broadcast traffic within a single network segment.

**Performance Considerations:**

* **Limiting Broadcast Traffic:**
  * To avoid performance issues, broadcast traffic should be limited.
  * **Subdividing Networks:**
    * Creating smaller subnetworks can help by reducing broadcast domains and limiting broadcast traffic to smaller groups of hosts.

#### Multicast Transmission

* **Multicast communication** allows a host to send a single packet to a specific group of hosts, reducing overall traffic.

**Multicast Address Range:**

* **IPv4 Multicast Range:** 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255.

**Local Network Multicast:**

* **Reserved Addresses:** 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255.
  * Used for multicast groups on the local network.
  * Routers recognize these addresses as local and do not forward them beyond the local network.
  * Example Use: Routing protocols like RIP version 2 use 224.0.0.9 for communication among routers.

**Multicast Clients:**

* Hosts that receive multicast data are called multicast clients.
* **Subscription:** Multicast clients subscribe to multicast groups using services requested by a client program.

**Operation:**

* Each multicast group is identified by a single IPv4 multicast destination address.
* Hosts subscribed to a multicast group will process packets sent to the multicast address as well as packets sent to their unique unicast addresses.

**Benefits of Multicast:**

* **Traffic Reduction:** By sending a single packet to multiple subscribed hosts, multicast reduces the amount of traffic compared to unicast or broadcast, which would require multiple or all hosts to process the data.

**Usage Example:**

* **Routing Protocols:** Local network multicast addresses are used in routing protocols to efficiently distribute routing information to all routers within the local network.

#### Static IPv4 Address Assignment

* **Static assignment** requires manual configuration of the network information for each host.

**Configuration Details:**

* Minimum configuration includes:
  * Host IPv4 address
  * Subnet mask
  * Default gateway

**Advantages:**

* **Stability:** Useful for devices like printers and servers that need consistent access.
* **Control:** Provides increased control over network resources.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Time-Consuming:** Manually entering information for each host is labor-intensive.
* **Error-Prone:** Basic error checks are performed, leading to potential configuration errors.

**Management:**

* **Documentation:** It is crucial to maintain an accurate list of assigned IPv4 addresses.
* **Permanence:** Static addresses are generally permanent and not reused.

#### DHCPv4 Operation

**Initial Configuration:**

* A DHCP client starts without an IPv4 address, subnet mask, or default gateway.
* It obtains this information from a DHCP server.

**DHCP Server Setup:**

* Configured with a pool of IPv4 addresses for assignment to clients.
* Can be located on the local network or another network (requiring DHCP relay).

**DHCP Process:**

1. **DHCP Discover:**
   * Client sends a broadcast message with destination IPv4 address 255.255.255.255 and MAC address FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF.
   * All hosts receive the broadcast, but only the DHCP server replies.
2. **DHCP Offer:**
   * DHCP server responds with a suggested IPv4 address.
3. **DHCP Request:**
   * Client requests to use the suggested IPv4 address.
4. **DHCP Acknowledgment:**
   * Server acknowledges and finalizes the lease of the IPv4 address to the client.

**Network Considerations:**

* Routers must be configured to forward DHCP requests if the server is on another network.

#### DHCP Service Configuration

**Home and Small Business Networks:**

* Typically, a wireless router provides DHCP services to local network clients.

**Configuration Steps:**

1. **Access Router Interface:**
   * Open a web browser.
   * Enter the router’s default IPv4 address (commonly 192.168.0.1) in the address field.
2. **Graphical Web Interface:**
   * Log in to the router’s web interface using default or set credentials.
   * Navigate to the DHCP settings section within the interface.
3. **DHCP Settings:**
   * Configure the range of IPv4 addresses to be assigned (DHCP pool).
   * Set lease duration for how long an IP address is assigned to a device.
   * Optionally, configure additional settings such as subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers.
4. **Save and Apply Changes:**

#### NAT Operation

* NAT enables internal hosts with private IP addresses to access the internet using the router's public IP address.
* The router performs address translation for outbound and inbound packets, allowing communication between local network clients and external internet hosts.
* This process conserves public IP addresses and provides a level of security by hiding internal network structure from the internet.

**Purpose of NAT:**

* **Translation Requirement:**
  * Private addresses cannot be routed on the internet.
  * NAT converts private addresses to public addresses to facilitate communication.

**How NAT Works:**

1. **Public Address Assignment:**
   * The ISP assigns a public IP address to the wireless router.
2. **Private Address Assignment:**
   * The router assigns private IP addresses to local network clients using DHCP.
3. **Packet Translation:**
   * Outbound Packets:
     * Private (local) source IP addresses are translated to the router's public (global) IP address.
   * Inbound Packets:
     * The router translates the public IP address back to the appropriate private IP address of the internal host.

**Packet Handling:**

* **Outbound Traffic:**
  * Internal hosts send packets with private source IP addresses.
  * The router replaces the private source IP with its public IP before forwarding the packets to the internet.
* **Inbound Traffic:**
  * Packets from the internet are destined for the router's public IP.
  * The router translates the destination public IP to the appropriate private IP of the internal host and forwards the packets.

**NAT Functionality:**

* **Sharing Public IP:**
  * All internal hosts share the router's single public IP address.
  * NAT manages multiple private IPs using the same public IP.
* **Gateway Role:**
  * The router acts as the gateway for all traffic between the internal network and the internet.
  * Only packets destined for outside networks are translated.

#### Need for IPv6

**Motivation:**

* **IPv4 Exhaustion:** IPv4 addresses are running out due to increased internet connectivity, particularly in Africa, Asia, and other growing regions.
* **Enhanced Capabilities:** IPv6 not only provides more addresses but also includes improvements over IPv4, such as ICMPv6, which supports address resolution and autoconfiguration.

**IPv6 Address Space:**

* **Size:** IPv6 provides a 128-bit address space, offering 340 undecillion addresses, compared to IPv4's 32-bit address space with 4.3 billion addresses.
* **Comparison:** IPv6 address space is vast enough to assign a unique address to virtually every grain of sand on Earth.

**Advantages of IPv6:**

* **No Need for NAT:** Each device can have a globally routable address, eliminating the complexities and limitations of NAT.
* **Autoconfiguration:** Simplifies address administration by allowing devices to configure their own IP addresses automatically.

**Current IPv6 Adoption:**

* **Mobile Providers:** Leading the transition, with over 90% of traffic on IPv6.
* **Top ISPs and Content Providers:** YouTube, Facebook, Netflix, and major companies like Microsoft and LinkedIn have transitioned to or are using IPv6 extensively.
* **Broadband Deployment:** Significant deployment in ISPs like Comcast (over 65%) and British Sky Broadcasting (over 86%).

**Internet of Things (IoT):**

* **Expanding Connectivity:** IoT includes diverse devices beyond traditional computers, such as cars, biomedical devices, and household appliances.
* **IPv6 Necessity:** The increasing number of connected devices requires the extensive address space provided by IPv6.

#### IPv4 and IPv6 Coexistence

**Overview:**

* **No Specific Deadline:** The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 does not have a set deadline and is occurring gradually over several years.
* **Coexistence:** Both IPv4 and IPv6 will operate simultaneously for the foreseeable future.

**Migration Techniques:**

1. **Dual Stack:**
   * **Description:** Enables IPv4 and IPv6 to run concurrently on the same network.
   * **Function:** Devices operate with both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stacks.
   * **Benefits:** Provides native IPv6 connectivity, allowing access to both IPv4 and IPv6 content on the internet.
2. **Tunneling:**
   * **Description:** Encapsulates IPv6 packets within IPv4 packets to traverse IPv4 networks.
   * **Function:** Transports IPv6 traffic over existing IPv4 infrastructure.
   * **Benefits:** Facilitates the integration of IPv6 into IPv4 networks without requiring immediate full transition.
3. **Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64):**
   * **Description:** Translates IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and vice versa.
   * **Function:** Allows communication between IPv6-only and IPv4-only devices.
   * **Benefits:** Ensures compatibility and connectivity between different IP versions during the transition period.

#### IPv6 Autoconfiguration and Link-Local Addresses

**Key Differences from IPv4:**

1. **Address Autoconfiguration:**
   * **Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC):**
     * **Purpose:** Allows hosts to automatically configure their own IPv6 addresses without a DHCP server.
     * **Process:**
       1. **Router Advertisement (RA):** The host receives the prefix (network address), prefix length (subnet mask), and default gateway from the Router Advertisement message sent by the router.
       2. **Interface ID Creation:** The host generates its own unique interface ID (the host portion of the address).
       3. **Result:** The host forms a global unicast address (GUA) that is routable on the internet.
   * **Benefits:** Simplifies network configuration, reduces dependency on DHCP servers, and allows for automatic and dynamic address assignment.
2. **Link-Local Address:**
   * **Purpose:** Used for communication between devices on the same local network segment (link).
   * **Characteristics:**
     * **Prefix:** Link-local addresses have the prefix `FE80::/10`.
     * **Scope:** Only valid and used within the local network segment, not routable on the internet.
   * **Usage:** Essential for initial network setup, local communication, and when no router or global address is available.

**IPv6 Protocol Improvements:**

* **Efficiency:** Streamlined header format to reduce processing overhead and improve packet handling.
* **Scalability:** Larger address space (128-bit addresses) supports a vast number of unique IP addresses.
* **Mobility:** Enhanced support for mobile devices and seamless address reconfiguration.
* **Flexibility:** Designed to accommodate future enhancements and emerging technologies.

#### IPv6 Address Representation

**Understanding the Challenge:**

* **IPv6 Address Length:** IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, represented as a series of 32 hexadecimal digits. This is a significant change from IPv4's 32-bit address written in dotted decimal notation.
* **Hexadecimal Notation:** IPv6 uses hexadecimal notation, where every 4 bits are represented by a single hexadecimal digit.

**Compression Techniques:** To make IPv6 addresses more readable, two main rules are used to compress them:

1. **Omit Leading Zeros:**
   * **Description:** Any leading zeros in a 16-bit section can be omitted.
   * **Examples:**
     * `0DB8` becomes `DB8`
     * `0000` becomes `0`
     * `0200` becomes `200`
2. **Omit One “All Zero” Segment:**
   * **Description:** A double colon (`::`) can replace any single, contiguous string of one or more 16-bit segments that are all zeros. The double colon can only be used once in an address.
   * **Example:**
     * `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329` can be compressed to `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`

**Full vs. Compressed IPv6 Address:**

* **Full Address:** `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:8329`
* **Compressed Address:** `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`

**Benefits of Compression:**

* **Readability:** Compressed addresses are significantly easier to read and write, reducing the likelihood of errors.
* **Convenience:** Simplifies the notation, making it more manageable for network administrators and users.

#### Examples of IPv6 Address Compression
