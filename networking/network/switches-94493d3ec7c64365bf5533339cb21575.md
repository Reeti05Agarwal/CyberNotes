## Switches

#### Choosing the Right Switch for Your LAN

When designing a Local Area Network (LAN), selecting a switch with the appropriate number and type of ports is essential. Different ports cater to different needs and network environments. Here's a guide to understanding the types of ports available on network switches and their uses:

## Types of Ports

#### Copper Twisted-Pair Interface Ports

* **Common Usage:** Most lower-cost switches support these ports, which are used for connecting typical network devices like computers, printers, and access points.
* **Cable Type:** Uses Ethernet cables, typically with RJ-45 connectors.
* **Distance Limitation:** Effective for distances up to 100 meters.
* **Speed:** Supports various Ethernet speeds (10/100/1000 Mbps or 1/10 Gbps).

#### Fiber-Optic Ports

* **Common Usage:** Found in higher-priced switches, used to link switches over longer distances.
* **Cable Type:** Uses fiber-optic cables, which can be either single-mode or multi-mode.
* **Distance:** Can cover distances ranging from hundreds of meters to several kilometers, depending on the type of fiber.
* **Speed:** Supports higher data rates, often 10 Gbps, 40 Gbps, or even 100 Gbps.

#### Specialized Ports and Switch Options

* **PoE (Power over Ethernet) Ports:** These ports provide electrical power to devices such as IP cameras, VoIP phones, and wireless access points over the same twisted-pair Ethernet cable used for data.
* **SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable) Ports:** These modular ports can support both copper and fiber connections via interchangeable SFP modules. This allows flexibility in connecting different types of network media.
* **Stacking Ports:** Some switches include ports designed specifically for stacking, which enables multiple switches to function as a single logical switch, simplifying management and expanding the network.

#### Cisco Catalyst 9300 Series Switches

* **Fixed and Modular Models:** Available in both, allowing for different port densities and types.
* **High Performance:** Supports high throughput and offers advanced features such as Quality of Service (QoS), security, and programmability.
* **PoE Options:** Models with PoE, PoE+, and UPOE (Universal Power over Ethernet) capabilities.
* **Uplinks:** Options for different uplink modules, including both fiber and copper, to connect to other switches or the backbone network.

#### Factors to Consider When Choosing a Switch

1. **Port Count:** Determine the number of devices you need to connect now and in the near future.
2. **Port Type:** Decide between copper and fiber ports based on the distance and speed requirements.
3. **Power Requirements:** If you have devices needing PoE, ensure the switch supports the necessary PoE standard and has sufficient power budget.
4. **Scalability:** Consider switches that support stacking or modular uplinks for future expansion.
5. **Budget:** Balance the cost with the required features and future-proofing your network investment.

#### Example Use Cases

* **Small Office/Home Office (SOHO):**
  * Typically requires a switch with 8-24 copper ports.
  * May benefit from a few PoE ports for IP phones or wireless access points.
* **Medium to Large Enterprises:**
  * Often need switches with 24-48 ports or more.
  * Require a mix of copper and fiber ports to connect various devices and link to the backbone network.
  * Higher-end models for core or distribution layers with advanced features like high-speed uplinks and redundant power supplies.

Cisco Catalyst switches are renowned for their advanced manageability features. Here's an example of how a network administrator might interact with a Cisco Catalyst switch:

#### Direct Console Access

In the figure, the network administrator is connecting to a Cisco Catalyst switch using a console cable. This direct connection allows for initial setup and configuration, even if the switch does not have network connectivity.

* **Console Cable Connection:** Provides a direct serial connection to the switch for initial configuration and troubleshooting.
* **CLI (Command Line Interface):** The Cisco IOS CLI offers a powerful way to configure and manage the switch with precise control over all features.

#### Features of Managed Switches

1. **Configuration Control:**
   * **Port Configuration:** Adjust settings for speed, duplex, and VLAN membership.
   * **VLANs:** Segregate network traffic into separate VLANs for better performance and security.
   * **Link Aggregation:** Combine multiple ports for increased bandwidth and redundancy.
2. **Security:**
   * **Port Security:** Restrict access based on MAC addresses to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting.
   * **ACLs:** Control the flow of traffic and filter packets based on various criteria.
   * **802.1X Authentication:** Enforce secure network access through authentication protocols.
3. **Monitoring and Diagnostics:**

   * **Syslog:** Centralized logging of system messages for monitoring and troubleshooting.
   * **NetFlow:** Analyze IP traffic data to understand network utilization and performance.
4. **Quality of Service (QoS):**
   * **Traffic Prioritization:** Ensure critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and low latency.
   * **Rate Limiting:** Control the rate of traffic sent or received on a network interface.

#### Factors to Consider When Choosing Managed Switches

1. **Network Size and Complexity:** Larger, more complex networks benefit more from the features of managed switches.
2. **Security Requirements:** Networks handling sensitive data or requiring high security need the advanced security features of managed switches.
3. **Performance Needs:** Managed switches provide tools for optimizing network performance, crucial for enterprise environments.
4. **Budget:** While more expensive, the investment in managed switches can pay off in terms of network control and reliability.

#### Conclusion

Managed switches like those from the Cisco Catalyst series offer significant advantages in terms of control, security, and performance monitoring. They are essential for medium to large enterprise networks where advanced configuration and management capabilities are necessary to ensure optimal network operation.

## Cisco Catalyst 9300 24 UPOE Switch

## Power Up the Switch

**Step 1. Check the components.**

Ensure all the components that came with the switch are available. These could include a console cable, power cord, Ethernet cable, and switch documentation.

**Step 2. Connect the cables to the switch.**

Connect the PC to the switch with a console cable and start a terminal emulation session. Connect the AC power cord to the switch and to a grounded AC outlet.

**Step 3**. Power up the switch.

Some Cisco switch models do not have an on/off switch, like the Cisco Catalyst 9300 48S switch shown in the figure. To power on the switch, plug one end of the AC power cord into the switch AC power connector, and plug the other end into an AC power outlet.

#### **In-Band and Out-of-Band Management**

When managing network devices such as switches and routers, administrators can use two primary methods: out-of-band management and in-band management. Both methods serve different purposes and are critical for effective network management.
