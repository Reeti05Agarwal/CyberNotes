# Network Attacks

* **Network interception attacks**
*   **Backdoor attacks**

    In cybersecurity, backdoors are weaknesses intentionally left by programmers or system and network administrators that bypass normal access control mechanisms. Backdoors are intended to help programmers conduct troubleshooting or administrative tasks. However, backdoors can also be installed by attackers after theyâ€™ve compromised an organization to ensure they have persistent access.
