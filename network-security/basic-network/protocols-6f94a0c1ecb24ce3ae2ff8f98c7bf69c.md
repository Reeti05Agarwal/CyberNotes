## Protocols

| **Protocol Characteristic** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Message format**          | When a message is sent, it must use a specific format or structure. Message formats depend on the type of message and the channel that is used to deliver the message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Message size**            | The rules that govern the size of the pieces communicated across the network are very strict. They can also be different, depending on the channel used. When a long message is sent from one host to another over a network, it may be necessary to break the message into smaller pieces in order to ensure that the message can be delivered reliably.                                                                                                           |
| **Timing**                  | Many network communication functions are dependent on timing. Timing determines the speed at which the bits are transmitted across the network. It also affects when an individual host can send data and the total amount of data that can be sent in any one transmission.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Encoding**                | Messages sent across the network are first converted into bits by the sending host. Each bit is encoded into a pattern of sounds, light waves, or electrical impulses depending on the network media over which the bits are transmitted. The destination host receives and decodes the signals in order to interpret the message.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Encapsulation**           | Each message transmitted on a network must include a header that contains addressing information that identifies the source and destination hosts, otherwise it cannot be delivered. Encapsulation is the process of adding this information to the pieces of data that make up the message. In addition to addressing, there may be other information in the header that ensures that the message is delivered to the correct application on the destination host. |
| **Message pattern**         | Some messages require an acknowledgment before the next message can be sent. This type of request/response pattern is a common aspect of many networking protocols. However, there are other types of messages that may be simply streamed across the network, without concern as to whether they reach their destination.                                                                                                                                          |

Set of rules that govern data communications. It represents an agreement between the communicating devices.

Without a protocol, two devices may be connected but not communicating, just as a person speaking French cannot be understood by a person who speaks only Japanese. Network protocols are a language that systems use to communicate with each other.

Some protocols are assigned port numbers by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).

## NAT

**Network Address Translation**

Devices in a local network use private IP addresses to communicate internally. To connect to the internet, they require a public IP address. Network Address Translation (NAT) allows a router to replace private IPs with its public one, enabling communication with the internet. NAT is part of the TCP/IP model's layers 2 and 3.

## **Communication protocols:**

used to establish connections between servers. So just by visiting one website, the device on your networks are using four different protocols: TCP, ARP, HTTPS, and DNS.

#### VNC

*   ARP:

    **Address Resolution Protocol**

    responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network.

    used to determine the MAC address of the next router or device on the path.

    used to translate the IP addresses that are found in data packets into the MAC address of the hardware device.

    allows a device to associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network. Each device on a network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices.

    Each device within a network has a ledger to store information on, which is called a cache. In the context of the ARP protocol, this cache stores the identifiers of other devices on the network.

    network access layer protocol in the TCP/IP model

    In order to map these two identifiers together (IP address and MAC address), the ARP protocol sends two types of messages:

    1. **ARP Request**
    2. **ARP Reply**

    ***

## Wireless Protocol :

Wi-fi (IEEE802.11.):

set of standards that define communications for wireless LANs. IEEE stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which is an organization that maintains Wi-Fi standards, and 802.11 is a suite of protocols used in wireless communications.

In 2004, a security protocol called the Wi-Fi Protected Access, or WPA, was introduced. WPA is a wireless security protocol for devices to connect to the internet. Since then, WPA has evolved into newer versions, like WPA2 and WPA3, which include further security improvements, like more advanced encryption

Wi-Fi is a marketing term commissioned by the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA). WECA has since renamed their organization Wi-Fi Alliance.

WPA3 encrypts traffic with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher as it travels from your device to the wireless access point. WPA2 and WPA3 offer two modes: personal and enterprise. Personal mode is best suited for home networks while enterprise mode is generally utilized for business networks and applications.

***

## Network Standards Organizations

An internet standard is the end result of a comprehensive cycle of discussion, problem solving, and testing. These different standards are developed, published, and maintained by a variety of organizations, as shown in the figure. When a new standard is proposed, each stage of the development and approval process is recorded in a numbered Request for Comments (RFC) document so that the evolution of the standard is tracked. RFCs for internet standards are published and managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

## The Protocol Stack

Successful communication between hosts requires interaction between a number of protocols. These protocols are implemented in software and hardware that are installed on each host and networking device.

The interaction between the different protocols on a device can be illustrated as a protocol stack, as shown in the figure. A stack illustrates the protocols as a layered hierarchy, with each higher-level protocol depending on the services of the protocols shown in the lower levels.

The separation of functions enables each layer in the stack to operate independently of others. For example, you can use your laptop computer connected to a cable modem at home to access your favorite website, or view the same website on your laptop using a wireless connection at the library. The function of the web browser is not affected by the change in the physical location, nor the method of connectivity.

## Ethernet

### The Rise of Ethernet

Here are the summarized points:

* **Proprietary Methods**: Initially, each vendor used its own methods and protocols, causing compatibility issues.

* **Timeline**: Ethernet standards have developed significantly over time, improving speed and flexibility.

### The Ethernet MAC Address

All communication requires a way to identify the source and destination. The source and destination in human communication are represented by names.

When your name is called, you listen to the message and respond. Other people in the room may hear the message, but they ignore it because it is not addressed to them.

On Ethernet networks, a similar method exists for identifying source and destination hosts. Each host connected to an Ethernet network is assigned a physical address which serves to identify the host on the network.

Every Ethernet network interface has a physical address assigned to it when it is manufactured. This address is known as the Media Access Control (MAC) address. The MAC address identifies each source and destination host on the network.

The animation has a topology consisting of a switch with links to four host PCs labeled, H1, H2, H3 and H4. H1 says I need to send information to H3. A frame appears on the screen of the PC and an expanded view of the frame appears above the PC. The frame consists of the framing addressing and data. The destination address CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC, the source address AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA and the data part of the frame is encapsulated. The frame from H1 is forwarded to the switch. The switch then forwards the frame out every interface but the interface connected to H1. When H2 and H4 receive the frame and they say This is not addressed to me. I shall ignore it. When H3 receives the frame it says This is mine.

💡 Determine the MAC address of a Windows computer on an Ethernet network using the \*\*ipconfig /all\*\* command.

## Encapsulation

Here are the summarized points:

* **Analogy**: Sending a letter involves using an accepted format for delivery and understanding, similar to computer network messages.
* **Encapsulation**: The process of placing one message format inside another (like a letter in an envelope).
* **De-encapsulation**: The reverse process, where the recipient removes the letter from the envelope.
* **Frame Format**: Each computer message is encapsulated in a frame before being sent over the network.
* **Frame Function**: Acts like an envelope, providing destination and source addresses.
* **Message Integrity**: The frame format and contents depend on the message type and communication channel.
* **Error Handling**: Incorrectly formatted messages are not delivered or processed successfully by the destination host.

## Ethernet Frame

The Ethernet protocol standards define many aspects of network communication including frame format, frame size, timing, and encoding.

When messages are sent between hosts on an Ethernet network, the hosts format the messages into the frame layout that is specified by the standards. Frames are also referred to as Layer 2 protocol data units (PDUs). This is because the protocols that provide the rules for the creation and format of the frame perform the functions that are specified at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.

The format for Ethernet frames specifies the location of the destination and source MAC addresses, and additional information including:

* Preamble for sequencing and timing
* Start of frame delimiter
* Length and type of frame
* Frame check sequence to detect transmission errors

The size of Ethernet frames is normally limited to a maximum of 1518 bytes and a minimum size of 64 bytes from the Destination MAC Address field through the Frame Check Sequence (FCS). The preamble and the Start of Frame Delimiter (SFD) are used to indicate the beginning of the frame. They are not used in the calculation of the frame size. Frames that do not match these limits are not processed by the receiving hosts. In addition to the frame formats, sizes and timing, Ethernet standards define how the bits making up the frames are encoded onto the channel. Bits are transmitted as either electrical impulses over copper cable or as light impulses over fiber-optic cable.

The diagram shows the fields of an Ethernet frame. From left to right the fields and their length are: Preamble and SFD, 8 bytes; destination MAC address, 6 bytes; source MAC address, 6 bytes; type / length, 2 bytes; data, 46 - 1500 bytes; and F C S, 4 bytes. Excluding the first field, the total number of bytes in the remaining fields is between 64 – 1518 bytes.

## Ethernet Frame Fields

*   **Client and Server Interaction:**

    * **Server Definition:** A server refers to a host running software applications that provide information or services to other connected hosts.
    * **Common Server Examples:** Web servers, email servers, financial transaction servers, music download servers, etc.
    * **Critical Factors for Interaction:** Complex interactions between servers and clients rely on agreed-upon standards and protocols.
    * **Client Software Example:** Web browsers like Chrome or Firefox.
    * **Multi-Tasking Capability:** A single computer can run multiple client software simultaneously, enabling users to perform various tasks such as checking email, browsing the web, instant messaging, and listening to audio streams.
    * **Common Types of Server Software:**
      1. **Web Server:** Serves web pages over the internet.
      2. **Email Server:** Handles email communication.
      3. **Financial Transaction Server:** Manages financial transactions securely.
    * **Client Requests a Web Page:**
      * **Client-Server Interaction:** In a client/server system, the client sends a request to a server, and the server responds by carrying out a function, such as sending the requested document back to the client.
      * **Web Page Requests:** When a person wants to view a web page, they use a device running web client software, like a web browser, to request the page.
      * **Web Browser and Web Server:** The combination of a web browser and a web server represents one of the most common instances of a client/server system.
      * **Location of Web Servers:** Web servers are typically located in server farms or data centers.
      * **Data Centers:** A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components. It can occupy one room, one or more floors, or an entire building.
      * **Cost of Data Centers:** Data centers are expensive to build and maintain, leading only large organizations to use privately built data centers. Smaller organizations may opt to lease server and storage services from larger data center organizations in the cloud to reduce costs.

    ## URI, URN, and URL

    Web resources and web services such as RESTful APIs are identified using a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). A URI is a string of characters that identifies a specific network resource. As shown in the figure, a URI has two specializations:

    * **Uniform Resource Name (URN)** - This identifies only the namespace of the resource (web page, document, image, etc.) without reference to the protocol.
    * **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)** - This defines the network location of a specific resource on the network. HTTP or HTTPS URLs are typically used with web browsers. Other protocols such as FTP, SFTP, SSH, and others can use a URL. A URL using SFTP might look like: sftp://sftp.example.com.

    These are the parts of a URI, as shown in the figure:

    * **Protocol/scheme** - HTTPS or other protocols such as FTP, SFTP, mailto, and NNTP
    * **Hostname** - www.example.com
    * **Path and file name** - /author/book.html
    * **Fragment** - #page155

    ## Protocol Operations

    A web server and a web client use specific protocols and standards in the process of exchanging information to ensure that the messages are received and understood, as shown in the figure. The various protocols necessary to deliver a web page function at the four different levels of the TCP/IP model are as follows:

    * **Application Layer Protocol** - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) governs the way that a web server and a web client interact. HTTP defines the format of the requests and responses exchanged between the client and server. HTTP relies on other protocols to govern how the messages are transported between client and server.
    * **Transport Layer Protocol** - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ensures that IP packets are sent reliably, and any missing packets are resent. TCP provides proper ordering of packets received out of order.
    * **Internetwork Layer Protocol** - The most common internetwork protocol is Internet Protocol (IP). IP is responsible for taking the formatted segments from TCP, assigning the logical addressing, and encapsulating them into packets for routing to the destination host.
    * **Network Access Layer** - The specific protocol at the network access layer, such as Ethernet, depends on the type of media and transmission methods used in the physical network.
    * **TCP and UDP:**
      * **Transport Protocols:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two common transport protocols used for managing the transfer of messages between hosts.
      * **Role of IP:** IP (Internet Protocol) is responsible for addressing and routing packets between source and destination hosts. It does not specify how the delivery or transportation of packets takes place.
      * **Application Layer:** Each service available over the network has its own application protocols implemented in the server and client software. These application protocols work in conjunction with TCP or UDP to enable communication between hosts.
      * **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication between hosts. It ensures that data packets are delivered in the correct order and without errors by establishing a connection, acknowledging received packets, and retransmitting lost packets if necessary.
      * **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** UDP provides unreliable, connectionless communication between hosts. It does not guarantee the delivery of data packets or their order, making it suitable for applications where speed and efficiency are prioritized over reliability, such as real-time streaming or online gaming.
      *   **TCP Reliability:**

          * **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):**
            * TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol used for transmitting data over the internet.
            * When an application requires acknowledgment of message delivery, it uses TCP.
            * TCP breaks messages into small pieces called segments and numbers them in sequence before passing them to the IP process for assembly into packets.
            * TCP keeps track of the segments sent to a specific host from a specific application and retransmits them if acknowledgment is not received within a certain period.
            * Only the lost segments are retransmitted, not the entire message, which helps conserve bandwidth and resources.
          * **Reliable Delivery:**
            * TCP ensures reliable delivery of data by reassembling message segments on the receiving host and passing them to the application.
            * Applications such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) utilize TCP to guarantee the delivery of data packets.
          * **UDP Best Effort Delivery:**
            * **User Datagram Protocol (UDP):**
              * UDP is a transport protocol that offers 'best effort' delivery without acknowledgment of receipt.
              * Unlike TCP, UDP does not ensure reliable delivery or require acknowledgment of data packets.
              * Applications such as streaming audio and voice over IP (VoIP) benefit from UDP due to its speed and lack of acknowledgment, which would otherwise slow down delivery.
            * **Example: Internet Radio:**
              * Internet radio is an example of an application that uses UDP.
              * With UDP, if some message packets are lost during transmission, they are not retransmitted.
              * Minor disruptions, such as a slight break in sound, may occur if packets are lost, but the transmission continues without waiting for acknowledgment or retransmission.
              * Using TCP in this scenario would result in more noticeable disruptions, as the transmission would pause to receive and retransmit lost packets.
          * **TCP and UDP Port Numbers:**
            * **Port Numbers:**
              * Port numbers are used to identify specific services or protocols requested by clients in a message delivered via TCP or UDP.
              * Each message contains both a source and destination port.
              * Port numbers are numeric identifiers within each segment used to track conversations between clients and servers.
            * **Layers in TCP/IP Model:**
              * The TCP/IP model consists of four layers: Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access.
              * Each layer in the model is involved in the conversation between a client and a server.
            * **Examples of Port Numbers and Protocols:**
              * HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) uses port 80 with TCP.
              * SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) uses port 25 with TCP.
              * DNS (Domain Name System) uses port 53 with UDP.
            * **Port Categories:**
              * **Well-Known Ports:** Associated with common network applications, ranging from 1 to 1023.
              * **Registered Ports:** Range from 1024 to 49151, used by organizations to register specific applications.
              * **Private Ports:** Range from 49152 to 65535, often used as source ports and available for any application to use.

          | 25              | TCP           | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)                |
          | 53              | UDP, TCP      | Domain Name System (DNS)                            |
          | 67              | UDP           | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) - Server |
          | 68              | UDP           | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - Client        |

          | 110             | TCP           | Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3)               |
          | 143             | TCP           | Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)             |
          | 161             | UDP           | Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)           |
          | 443             | TCP           | Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)          |

    Some applications may use both TCP and UDP. For example, DNS uses UDP when clients send requests to a DNS server. However, communication between two DNS servers always uses TCP.

* **Destination and Source Port Numbers:**
  * **Source Port:**
    * Dynamically generated by the sending device to identify a conversation between two devices.
    * Allows multiple conversations to occur simultaneously, enabling efficient communication.
    * Each separate conversation is tracked based on the source ports.
  * **Destination Port:**
    * Placed in the segment by the client to indicate the service being requested by the destination server.
    * Helps the server identify the requested service.
    * Servers can offer multiple services simultaneously, each associated with a specific port number.
  * **Example:**
    * The figure depicts a computer with three different applications open, each associated with specific protocols and port numbers:
      * **POP3 (Post Office Protocol Version 3):**
        * Associated with electronic mail and uses port 110.
      * **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
        * Associated with HTML pages and uses port 80.
      * **SSH (Secure Shell):**
        * Associated with remote access and uses port 22.

## Socket Pairs

The source and destination ports are placed within the segment. The segments are then encapsulated within an IP packet. The IP packet contains the IP address of the source and destination. The combination of the source IP address and source port number, or the destination IP address and destination port number is known as a socket.

In the example in the figure, the PC is simultaneously requesting FTP and web services from the destination server.

The figure depicts a PC making both an FTP connection and a web connection to a server. The requests have source and destination port numbers which identify the host PC and the requested application service respectively.

In the example, the FTP request generated by the PC includes the Layer 2 MAC addresses and the Layer 3 IP addresses. The request also identifies the source port number 1305 (dynamically generated by the host) and destination port, identifying the FTP services on port 21. The host also has requested a web page from the server using the same Layer 2 and Layer 3 addresses. However, it is using the source port number 1099 (dynamically generated by the host) and destination port identifying the web service on port 80.

The socket is used to identify the server and service being requested by the client. A client socket might look like this, with 1099 representing the source port number: 192.168.1.5:1099

The socket on a web server might be 192.168.1.7:80

Together, these two sockets combine to form a _socket pair_: 192.168.1.5:1099, 192.168.1.7:80

Sockets enable multiple processes, running on a client, to distinguish themselves from each other, and multiple connections to a server process to be distinguished from each other.

The source port number acts as a return address for the requesting application. The transport layer keeps track of this port and the application that initiated the request so that when a response is returned, it can be forwarded to the correct application.

The `netstat` command is a network utility used to display active TCP connections on a networked host. It provides information about the protocols in use, local and foreign addresses, port numbers, and connection states.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial component of the internet infrastructure that enables users to access servers using human-readable names instead of numerical IP addresses. Here's a summary of how DNS works:

* **Purpose:** DNS translates domain names (e.g., [www.cisco.com](http://www.cisco.com/)) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to locate servers on the internet.
* **Organization:** DNS organizes domain names into specific high-level groups or domains, such as .com, .edu, and .net.
* **Functionality:** When a user requests a website by entering its domain name in a web browser, the browser sends a DNS query to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
* **Resolution Process:** The DNS server searches its database for the corresponding IP address associated with the domain name and returns it to the user's device.
* **Topology:** In a network topology, DNS servers are typically located within Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks, alongside routers and switches. These servers facilitate the translation of domain names to IP addresses for users accessing websites hosted on various servers across the internet.

Here's a summary of how DNS servers work:

* **Function:** DNS servers store tables associating hostnames with corresponding IP addresses, allowing clients to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
* **Client Request:** When a client needs to find the IP address of a server (e.g., a web server), it sends a request to the DNS server on port 53, the standard port for DNS queries.
* **DNS Server Configuration:** The client uses the IP address of the DNS server configured in its DNS settings to send the request.
* **Query Process:** Upon receiving the request, the DNS server checks its table (known as a DNS cache) to determine if it has an entry for the requested hostname.
* **Resolution:** If the DNS server has the IP address in its cache, it immediately sends the response back to the client.
* **Recursive Query:** If the DNS server doesn't have the requested IP address in its cache, it queries other DNS servers within the domain to resolve the hostname.
* **Response:** Once the DNS server obtains the IP address, it sends the information back to the client, allowing the client to communicate with the desired web server.
* **Timeout:** If the DNS server cannot determine the IP address (e.g., due to network issues or misconfiguration), the request will time out, and the client won't be able to access the web server.

DNS servers play a crucial role in translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses, facilitating seamless communication between clients and servers on the internet.

Here's a breakdown of HTTP and HTML:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

* **Purpose:** HTTP is a protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the World Wide Web. It facilitates communication between web clients (such as browsers) and web servers.
* **Usage:** When a client sends a request to access a web page, it uses HTTP to communicate with the server. This request typically includes the URL of the desired web page.
* **Port:** HTTP requests are sent over port 80 by default.
* **Security:** HTTP is not inherently secure, as data transmitted using HTTP can be intercepted by malicious actors. For secure communication, HTTPS (HTTP Secure) can be used, which encrypts data using SSL/TLS protocols and operates over port 443.
* **Interoperability:** HTTP is standardized and widely implemented across various web servers and clients, enabling interoperability between different systems.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

* **Purpose:** HTML is a markup language used to create and structure web pages. It defines the structure and layout of content on a web page, including text, images, links, and multimedia elements.
* **Encoding:** Web pages are encoded using HTML, which consists of a set of tags that define the structure and formatting of the content. These tags are interpreted by web browsers to render the page correctly.
* **Interactivity:** HTML supports hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between different web pages by clicking on links. It also supports forms, enabling user input and interaction with web applications.
* **Standardization:** HTML is an open standard maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ensuring compatibility and consistency across different web browsers and platforms.

Here's a summary of File Transfer Protocol (FTP):

* **Purpose:** FTP is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. It provides a simple and efficient method for users to upload, download, and manage files on remote servers.
* **Functionality:** FTP allows users to perform various file management operations, including uploading files from a client to a server, downloading files from a server to a client, renaming files, deleting files, creating directories, and listing directory contents.
* **Port Usage:** FTP uses two separate ports for communication between the client and server:
  * Control Connection: The client initiates a connection to the server's port 21 to establish a control connection. This connection is used for sending commands and receiving responses related to file management operations.
  * Data Connection: When file transfers are initiated, the server uses port 20 for data transfer. This port is used to transmit the actual file data between the client and server.
* **Client Software:** FTP client software is available as standalone applications or built into operating systems and web browsers. These clients provide graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that make it easy for users to interact with FTP servers, upload and download files, and manage remote file systems.
* **Usage:** FTP is commonly used for website maintenance, software distribution, file sharing, and remote file backups. It is widely supported across different platforms and is suitable for transferring both small and large files over a network.

Overall, FTP is a versatile protocol that facilitates efficient file transfer and management between computers connected to a network, providing users with a convenient method for accessing and manipulating files stored on remote servers.

Telnet, developed in the early 1970s, is an application layer protocol used to remotely access computer systems over a network. It enables users to emulate text-based terminal devices and interact with a server's command line interface. Telnet operates over TCP port 23, and a connection using Telnet is called a virtual terminal (vty) session.

Telnet allows users to execute commands on a server as if they were locally connected to it. However, it is not considered secure because all data exchanged during Telnet sessions is transported as plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access. Despite its lack of security, Telnet is sometimes used for simplicity of configuration.

To address security concerns, the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol is recommended as an alternative to Telnet. SSH provides secure remote login and other network services by encrypting session data and offering stronger authentication mechanisms. Unlike Telnet, SSH ensures that intercepted data remains encrypted and unusable by unauthorized users.

In summary, while Telnet facilitates remote access to servers, its lack of encryption makes it vulnerable to security threats. SSH, on the other hand, provides enhanced security features and encryption, making it the preferred choice for secure server access.
