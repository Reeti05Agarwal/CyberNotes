# MAC

### MAC ADDRESSES:

**M**edia **A**ccess **C**ontrol

Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a **MAC** (**M**edia **A**ccess **C**ontrol ) address. The MAC address is a **twelve-character** hexadecimal number split into two's and separated by a colon.

SPOOFING:

This spoofing occurs when a networked device pretends to identify as another using its MAC address. When this occurs, it can often break poorly implemented security designs that assume that devices talking on a network are trustworthy.

***

* Does not change; physically assigned to the host NIC.
* Known as the physical address.
* Remains the same regardless of the host's network location.
