# Caesar Cipher

It simply shifts a string of letters a certain number of positions up or down the alphabet.

EXAMPLE:

```dart
Original: hello world

Final: ebiil tloia

ENCRYPTION: LEFT 3
```

&#x20;**Strings containing incomprehensibly jumbled letters are possible Caesar ciphers**

* A key is chosen by the parties, which will be a number between 0 and 25. Then, each letter in the message is shifted forward or backward by that key to receive the encrypted message.&#x20;
* For example, “This is an example” with a forward shift of 1 gives the encrypted message: “Uijt jt bo fybnqmf”.&#x20;
* It is very easy to break as you can just apply all possible 26 forward and backward shifts and only one key will likely give an intelligible answer.
