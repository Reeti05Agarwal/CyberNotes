# MD5 Hash

This system is commonly used to check the integrity of files (like downloads). The way MD5 hashes are created, any slight variation in a file creates a new hash that is completely different than the previous, making changes in files (e.g. corruption in download or tampering) very apparent.

```dart
md5sum
