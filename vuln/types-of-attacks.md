Many of the most damaging computer worms like Nimbda, CodeRed, BugBear, Klez and Slammer are better categorized as blended attacks, as shown below:

* Some Nimbda variants used email attachments; file downloads from a compromised web server; and Microsoft file sharing (e.g., anonymous shares) as propagation methods.
* Other Nimbda variants were able to modify the systemâ€™s guest accounts to provide the attacker or malicious code with administrative privileges.

The recent Conficker and ZeuS/LICAT worms were also blended attacks. Conficker used all the traditional distribution methods.
