## Social Engineering

**social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

There are multiple stages of social engineering attacks. The first is usually to prepare. At this stage, attackers gather information about their target. Using the intel, they'll determine the best way to exploit them.

In the next stage, attackers establish trust. This is often referred to as pretexting. Here, attackers use the information they gathered earlier to open a line of communication. They'll typically disguise themselves to trick their target into a false sense of trust.

After that, attackers use persuasion tactics. This stage is where the earlier preparation really matters. This is when the attacker manipulates their target into volunteering information. Sometimes they do this by using specific vocabulary that makes them sound like a member of the organization.

The final stage of the process is to disconnect from the target. After they collect the information they want, attackers break communication with their target. They disappear to cover their tracks.

TO PREVENT:

Implementing managerial controls like policies, standards, and procedures, are one of the first lines of defense. Staying informed of trends is also a major priority for any security professional. An even better defense against social engineering attacks is sharing what you know with others.

### **Signs of an attack**

*   **Baiting**

    tempts people into compromising their security. A common example is USB baiting.
*   **Phishing**

    trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. It is one of the most common forms of social engineering, typically performed via email.

    Attackers who carry out these attacks commonly use **phishing kits** which is a collection of software tools needed to launch a phishing campaign. Each of the tools inside are designed to avoid detection.&#x20;

    1.  **malicious attachments**&#x20;

        Infected files that can cause harm to the organization's systems.
    2.  **fake-data collection forms**

        These forms look like legitimate forms, like a survey. Unlike a real survey, they ask for sensitive information that isn't normally asked for in an email.
    3.  **fraudulent web links**

        These open to malicious web pages that are designed to look like trusted brands. Unlike actual websites, these fraudulent sites are built to steal information, like login credentials.

    Organizations also use intrusion prevention systems to look for unusual patterns in email traffic. Security analysts use monitoring tools like this to spot suspicious emails, quarantine them, and produce a log of events.

    TYPES:

    * **Email phishing:** via email
    * **Smishing:** uses Short Message Service (SMS)
    * **Vishing** voice calls or voice messages
    * **Spear phishing** is a subset of email phishing in which specific people are purposefully targeted, such as the accountants of a small business.
    * **Whaling** refers to a category of spear phishing attempts that are aimed at high-ranking executives in an organization.
*   **Quid pro quo**

    trick someone into believing that theyâ€™ll be rewarded in return for sharing access, information, or money.
*   **Tailgating**

    in which unauthorized people follow an authorized person into a restricted area. This technique is also sometimes referred to as piggybacking.
*   **Watering hole**

    when a threat actor compromises a website frequently visited by a specific group of users. Oftentimes, these watering hole sites are infected with malicious software. An example is the _Holy Water attack of 2020_ that infected various religious, charity, and volunteer websites.

## Shoulder Surfing and Dumpster Diving

A criminal observes, or shoulder surfs, to pick up PINs, access codes or credit card numbers. An attacker can be in close proximity to his victim or the attacker can use binoculars or closed circuit cameras to shoulder surf. That is one reason that a person can only read an ATM screen at certain angles. These types of safeguards make shoulder surfing much more difficult.

"One man's trash is another man's treasure". This phrase can be especially true in the world of dumpster diving which is the process of going through a target's trash to see what information an organization throws out. Consider securing the trash receptacle. Any sensitive information should be properly disposed of through shredding or the use of burn bags, a container that holds classified or sensitive documents for later destruction by fire.

## Impersonation and Hoaxes

Impersonation is the action of pretending to be someone else. For example, a recent phone scam targeted taxpayers. A criminal, posing as an IRS employee, told the victims that they owed money to the IRS. The victims must pay immediately through a wire transfer. The impersonator threatened that failure to pay will result in an arrest. Criminals also use impersonation to attack others. They can undermine the credibility of individuals by using website or social media postings.

A hoax is an act intended to deceive or trick. A cyber hoax can cause just as much disruption as an actual breach would cause. A hoax elicits a user reaction. The reaction can create unnecessary fear and irrational behavior. Users pass hoaxes through email and social media.

## Piggybacking and Tailgating

Piggybacking occurs when a criminal tags along with an authorized person to gain entry into a secure location or a restricted area. Criminals use several methods to piggyback:

* They give the appearance of being escorted by the authorized individual
* They join a large crowd pretending to be a member
* They target a victim who is careless about the rules of the facility

Tailgating is another term that describes the same practice.

A mantrap prevents piggybacking by using two sets of doors. After individuals enter an outer door, that door must close before entering the inner door.
