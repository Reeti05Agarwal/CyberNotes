Frameworks & Controls
# Frameworks & Controls

## Frameworks

**Security frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. Frameworks support organizations’ ability to adhere to compliance laws and regulations.  

**Cyber Threat Framework (CTF):** a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity. 

**International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001:** An internationally recognized and used framework is ISO/IEC 27001. The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties. This framework outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization’s ability to manage risks. Although the ISO/IEC 27001 framework does not require the use of specific controls, it does provide a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture.

## **Controls**

safeguards designed to reduce *specific* security risks. Security controls are the measures organizations use to lower risk and threats to data and privacy.

### Control categories:

1. **Administrative/Managerial controls:**
    
    address the human component of cybersecurity.

2. **Technical controls:**
    
    consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc. Technical controls can be used in a number of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.

1. **Physical/Operational controls:** 
    
    include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers, etc. They are used to limit physical access to physical assets by unauthorized personnel.

- **The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)**
    
    FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. These types of organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. They are also legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC.
    
- **The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®)**
    
    FedRAMP is a U.S. federal government program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings. Its purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third-party cloud providers.
    
- **Center for Internet Security (CIS®)**
    
    CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. Its purpose is to help organizations establish a better plan of defense. CIS also provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs.
    
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
    
    GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.
    
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**
    
    PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud.
    
- **The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**
    
    HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. It is governed by three rules:
    
    1. Privacy
    2. Security
    3. Breach notification
    
    Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if patients' **Protected Health Information** (PHI) is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud. PHI relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, whether it’s a plan of care or payments for care. Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, security professionals also need to be familiar with the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.
    
- **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**
    
    ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste, and services.
    
- **System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)**
    
    The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) auditing standards board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels such as:
    
    - Associate
    - Supervisor
    - Manager
    - Executive
    - Vendor
    - Others
